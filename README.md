# Push Swap Tester

This repository contains a testing script for the `push_swap` program.

## Overview

The `push_swap` program is a sorting algorithm project in the 42 curriculum. This tester script helps verify the correctness and efficiency of the `push_swap` program by running multiple tests with varying input sizes.

## Prerequisites

- `make` command for compiling the `push_swap` program
- `python3` for running the testing script

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chikhidev/push_swap_tester.git
cd push_swap_tester
chmod +x runner.sh
./runner.sh
```

## Test Configuration
